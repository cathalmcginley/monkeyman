# Organizing your posts

As I said before, a blog typically doesn't exist of a single
post. (Correct that: the majority of blogs _do_ actually exist of a
single post, in which the author announces that he started his blog,
and that it's all going to be a marvelous adventure, after which his
blog goes numb. However, you are obviously not one of them.)

Adding another page to a Monkeyman site is not that hard. In fact, the
page you are reading here was added just by adding a `2.md` file to
the `source` folder. That's it. Monkeyman _will_ generate a proper
HTML page from that as well, provided you added the layout as I
mentioned in the previous post.

However, even a bunch of HTML pages doesn't make a blog yet. You need
to have a way to keep things organized. For instance, it's not
uncommon to have an `index.html` page that contains your latest
posts. And it's also not uncommon to have the ability to point back
and forth between different posts.

## Have a landing page

When I said a minute ago that we wanted to have an index.html page, I
really meant that we want to have a default landing page from which we
can link to our posts. For static sites, this typically is the
index.html page, since many hosting providers will redirect a naked
path type of URL to the `index.html` page in that directory.

So, we need an index.html page as well. Now, by default, Monkeyman has
a pretty straightforward to transform file system resources into
output resources, and by default, it's always _one-to-one_. For a
given Markdown file, it will turn it into just a single HTML file.

Monkeyman _could_ have had something plugged in that renames the most
recent (more on that in a minute) file to `index.html`, but that would
not be ideal from an SEO and permalink perspective. You _really_ want
to have your post to have a nicely formatted URL, and it needs to keep
that name forever. Changing it from index.html to something else will
break links and also confuse web crawlers.

Therefore, what you do need is the ability to _include_ HTML fragments
into other pages. That is _exactly_ what Monkeyman allows you to do as
well: all Resources have a method called `asHtmlFragment:
Option[String]`. You can use that method to extract the raw HTML
before the layout was applied.

Having the ability to _include_ portions of other pages into other
pages is _the first_ thing we need. But we also need something
else. We need to be able to _reach out_ to those resources whose HTML
fragments we want to include. How do we do that?

The answer is easy. For every template page (layout pages or other
template pages) Monkeyman includes an `allResources` variable, which
is a `Seq[Resource]`. Including _all_ resources in your page clearly
doesn't make a lot of sense, but once you have _all resources_, you
can filter out the ones you want to use by using Scala's usual
collection operations, such as `filter(...)`.

Now we have all of the different bits and pieces to create a landing
page, let's create one. Open `index.scaml` in the source directory,
and add this:

    %html
      %head
        %title Monkeyman Blog
        %link(href={uri("css/default.css")} rel="stylesheet" type="text/css")
      %body
        - for (resource <- allResources.filter(res => res.tags.contains("blog")).take(3))
          .post
            %h1.title
              %a(href={resource.path})= resource.title
            .body
              - unescape(resource.asHtmlFragment)
            .tags
              - for (tag <- resource.tags - "blog")
                %span.tag= tag
    
The file itself is only _a little_ different than the `layout.scaml`
file we created before. This time we added it to the `source`
directory. Why? Well, because this is not just a layout we want to be
applied to other pages. This is a page that we actually want to have
generated as a resource _itself_.

In this particular case, the template grabs the list of all resources
found by Monkeyman, and then filters out the ones that have been
marked with the `blog` tag. From that list, it picks the first three.

With that list of three resources marked `blog`, it now traverses all
three of them, and inserts the post inside the `index.html` page. The
`resource.asHtmlFragment` gets the content of that page as an HTML
snippet. To top it of, it changes the title slightly and includes a
hyperlink to the _actual_ permanent representation of that post.

As you can see, creating a page that includes fragments or metadata
from other pages isn't all that hard. In this particular case, we used
the `blog` tag to filter out the ones we need. That's not
required. You could also have used a certain naming convention, like
store all your blog posts in a certain director and filter on
that. Monkeyman doesn't enforce a particular way of working; you can
combine content in any way you like.

Now, this is all very nice, but perhaps it listed the pages you
expected to see in the wrong order. That is annoying. But we can
easily solve that using the mechanisms that we have just learned
about.

## Sorting by publication date

First a word on publication dates itself. _Every_ resource has a
publication date and time. By default it just picks the last
modification date of the file from which it was created. If that seems
weird to you, then you will happy to know that this is something you
can actually override.  This is - again - one of the areas in which
Monkeyman will grow, but for now you can override it using YAML
frontmatter, just like the resource's title.

    ---
    pubDateTime: 1992-23-01
    ---

Adding the above to the top of your Markdown file will force the
pubDateTime to be set to January 23, 1992.

Including the publication date in your page is easy, but if you want
to format it in your own way, then you (currently) have to create a
DateTimeFormatter for it.

    - val dateFormat = org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormat.forPattern("EEEE d MMMM, hh:mm")
    ...
    %h1.title
      %a(href={resource.path})= resource.title
    .pubDate= dateFormat.print(resource.pubDateTime)
    .body
    ...

But just adding the publication date to a post doesn't sort it yet. In
order to get it sorted, you need to change the way we loop over the
results of our `allSources` query:

    - val matching = allResources
    -   .filter(_.tags.contains("blog"))
    -   .sortBy(_.pubDateTime)
    -   .reverse
    -   .take(3)
    - for (resource <- matching)

In order to make it a little easier on the eyes, I split it up into
several lines: first, I'm getting all resources with a "blog"
tag. Then I'm sorting those resources by their publication date
time. (Note that even though LocalDateTime itself is not _comparable_,
you don't have to bother passing your own
`Ordering[LocalDateTime]`. That value is implicitly included. That's
for Scala experts. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you
should just ignore and it, and read: "there is nothing else I need to
do".)

Now we have the list sorted by date. Only, it's in the wrong order. We
need reverse order. There are better ways for achieving it, but let's
for now simply reverse the entire list. Once that is done, I'm
grabbing the first three items. That's it. The entire `index.html` now
looks like this:

    - val dateFormat = org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormat.forPattern("EEEE d MMMM, hh:mm")
    %html
      %head
        %title
        %link(href={uri("css/default.css")} rel="stylesheet" type="text/css")
      %body
        - val matching = allResources
        -   .filter(_.tags.contains("blog"))
        -   .sortBy(_.pubDateTime)
        -   .reverse
        -   .take(3)
        - for (resource <- matching)
          .post
            %h1.title
              %a(href={resource.path})= resource.title
            .pubDate= dateFormat.print(resource.pubDateTime)
            .body
              - unescape(resource.asHtmlFragment)
            .tags
              - for (tag <- resource.tags - "blog")
                %span.tag= tag
